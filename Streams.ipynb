    "####  Explain the key differences that you see in the file between C++ and C.\n",
    "1. Instead of .c extension, C++ uses .cc extension for source files.\n",
    "2. .h extensions are not specified for C++ standard libraries.\n",
    "3. Namespace is instroduced in C++, while C use including libraries.\n",
    "4. C++ has itw own string type, while C use a character array for a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Describe the concept of a namespace, and what :: means.\n",
    "The namespace is used to logically group codes. Python uses import and dot (.) to access to different libraries. C++ uses the symbol :: to look inside a namespace.\n",
    "In our example, we use std:: that denotes the \"standard namespace\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Describe how streams do things differently. In particular, explain the differences in reading from command line arguments, reading and writing to a file, printing to standard output, and printing to standard error.\n",
    "1. **cout** takes a string as a stream and prints it to stdout.\n",
    "2. The stream operator **<<** automatically converts types. In our example, the C-string (char \\*) of argv[0] (user console input) is converted to a true C++ string, then passed as a stream to **cout**.\n",
    "3. `getline(cin, input_str)` takes an user input in console. It converts the input to C++ true string type and store it into the input_str variable.\n",
    "4. `stringstream(input_str) >> fnum` takes a string and parse it into different typse. In our example, it converts the string number to a true float or int type.  \n",
    "5. `ofstream output_file` handle a file stream. Here output_file variable is defined as a file stream.\n",
    "6. **cerr** is another pipe dedicated for standard output like **cout**. It is purposed to display an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explain how a C++ string differs from a C string.\n",
    "C string is based on a character array, while C++ string has its own data type. It is much easier to join. C++ uses two expressions handling a string: 1) single-character literals - single quote (') and 2) more than one character - double quotes (\").\n"
